OpenSextant
===========
The Open Spatial Extraction and Tagging (OpenSextant) software provides an unstructured textual data geotagging and geocoding capability. The U.S. Government Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) developed this capability in coordination with other U.S. government agencies and is pleased to provide this as open source software using an Apache 2.0 license. The software relies upon the open source General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) natural language processing software and the Apache Solr search software. Please see below for instructions on how to access the source code and binaries. 


OpenSextant Toolbox
=================

 The OpenSextant Toolbox is a GATE based geotagger. Based on the GATE open source text processing framework, 
 the OpenSextant Toolbox adds a set of processing resources (plugins) which are then assembled to produce a full
 geotagging pipeline. It builds upon the OpenSextant Gazetteer and SolrTextTagger projects.
